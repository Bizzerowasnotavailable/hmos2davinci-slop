# hmos2sweet

**HarmonyOS 5 (OpenHarmony) for the Redmi Note 10 Pro (sweet).**

`hmos2sweet` takes a **HarmonyOS full OTA package** (`update_full_base.zip`) and turns it into a ROM you can flash
on the Redmi Note 10 Pro. The userspace stays Huawei's. What changes is underneath it:

- a LineageOS 4.14 (sm6150) kernel with the patches OpenHarmony needs;
- a set of **selectable patches** that replace the Kirin drivers with Snapdragon 732G equivalents: display, GPU,
  audio, coprocessors, telephony and more.

> Experimental project. No Huawei or Xiaomi image is included in this repository: the script takes them from
> the packages you provide. Use the resulting ROM for personal use only.

## Status

Tested with: Huawei Pura 70 HarmonyOS 5.1 full OTA (`ADY-LGRP3-CHN 205.1.0.128(SP5)`, `update_full_base.zip`).
Other HarmonyOS 5.x versions of the Pura 70 should convert as well: the patches that edit system files check what
they find and skip the step if the file is not the expected one.

## Requirements

- **Linux** (or **WSL** on Windows) with Python 3.8+, `e2fsprogs` (`debugfs`), `unzip`, `curl`.
  `pip install brotli`, or the `brotli` command, if the sweet ROM uses `vendor.new.dat.br`.
- About **25 GB free**: extracted images, temporary trees and output.
- A **HarmonyOS full OTA** of the Huawei Pura 70 (`update_full_base.zip`, the one with `update.bin` inside).
  `fetchfw` (below) can find and download one for you.
- **A ROM for the Redmi Note 10 Pro** with block images (`vendor.new.dat.br` + `vendor.transfer.list`, e.g.
  LineageOS), or an extracted `vendor.img`. It provides sweet's GPU, IPA, audio amplifier, WiFi and camera
  firmware and its audio mixer paths.
- A phone with an **unlocked bootloader**, `fastboot` and `adb` (platform-tools) in PATH, and a recovery
  (TWRP/OrangeFox) to read the logs.

## Getting the firmware: fetchfw

`fetchfw` lists the HarmonyOS packages available for the **Huawei Pura 70**, lets you pick one, downloads it
(resumable, sha256-checked) and then starts `hmos2sweet.py` on it:

```sh
python3 fetchfw.py                                        # choose, download, port
python3 fetchfw.py -- --sweet-rom ~/lineage-sweet.zip --patches defaults
python3 fetchfw.py --list                                 # only list
python3 fetchfw.py --url <package URL>                    # check and add a package you found
python3 fetchfw.py --online                               # also ask Huawei's update service (experimental)
```

On Windows `fetchfw.bat` does the same. Huawei's CDN paths contain a random id, so packages cannot be
enumerated: candidates come from the catalog in `lib/fetchfw_catalog.json`, from your own list
(`~/.hmos2sweet_fw.json`, filled automatically by `--url`) and, with `--online`, from Huawei's update query
service (undocumented protocol, best effort). **Every candidate is verified before it is offered**: its
`filelist.xml` and the headers inside the zip (`packageinfo.mbn`, `VERSION.mbn`, read with HTTP range
requests) must describe a full BASE package of a Pura 70 (`ADY-*`); anything else is rejected.

## Usage

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<you>/hmos2sweet && cd hmos2sweet
tools/fetch_tools.sh                     # downloads the EROFS tools into tools/bin
python3 hmos2sweet.py --ota ~/update_full_base.zip --sweet-rom ~/lineage-sweet.zip --out out
```

The patch list opens:

```
  Patches to apply  (number = toggle, a = all, n = none, d = defaults,
                     i<number> = details, Enter = continue, q = quit)

     [=] Core: kernel, preinit, fstab
   1 [x] Display: DRM/KMS composer + buffer allocator
   2 [x] GPU: Mesa freedreno (Adreno 618) for OpenGL ES
   ...
```

- a number (or several, separated by spaces) toggles a patch;
- `a` enables everything, `n` disables everything, `d` goes back to the defaults;
- `i3` shows the description of patch 3;
- Enter continues.

Dependencies are handled automatically: enabling audio also enables "Modem/ADSP bring-up", disabling the
latter also disables audio and WiFi.

Without the menu (scripts, CI):

```sh
python3 hmos2sweet.py --ota OTA.zip --sweet-rom ROM.zip --patches defaults            # defaults
python3 hmos2sweet.py --ota OTA.zip --sweet-rom ROM.zip --patches all,-60             # all but debug-tools
python3 hmos2sweet.py --ota OTA.zip --sweet-rom ROM.zip --patches defaults --no-setup-wizard
python3 hmos2sweet.py --list                                                          # patch list
```

### Setup wizard

HarmonyOS's first-boot setup needs a WiFi connection. WiFi works on sweet, so the wizard is kept by default.
If you cannot get through it, enable the **"Remove the setup wizard"** patch (or pass `--no-setup-wizard`):

- it removes `HwStartupGuide` from `system.img` (the original files are saved in `out/removed/`);
- it marks the first boot as completed in the settings database (`device_provisioned`, `user_setup_complete`).

## Installation

The output folder contains:

| File | |
|---|---|
| `system.img`, `vendor.img`, `chip_prod.img`, `sys_prod.img`, `cust.img`, `patch.img` | logical partitions (in `super`) |
| `boot.img`, `dtbo.img` | kernel + HarmonyOS ramdisk with `hmos-preinit` |
| `install_clean.bat` / `.sh` | **first install**: wipes Android and ALL data, creates the HarmonyOS partitions |
| `update_keep_data.bat` / `.sh` | update from a previous hmos2sweet build, **data is kept** |
| `get_logs.bat` / `.sh` | from recovery: copies the kernel log, hilog and boot screenshots |
| `BUILD_INFO.txt` | OTA version and patches used |
| `removed/` | files taken out of the images (setup wizard) |

1. Phone in fastboot (Power + Volume down).
2. `install_clean.bat` (Windows) or `./install_clean.sh` (Linux). It asks you to type `YES`.
3. The first boot takes a few minutes.

To go back to Android, flash a sweet ROM again from recovery: the ROM recreates `super`.

### Power off and charging

With a charger or a PC connected, "power off" makes the PMIC start the phone again in charging mode
(`androidboot.mode=charger`). `hmos-preinit` recognises it and does not start HarmonyOS: the screen stays off
and the phone keeps charging. Unplugging the cable powers it off; holding the power key for 1.5 s boots
HarmonyOS.

### Logs

The ramdisk contains `hmos-preinit`, which saves to the `cache` partition on every boot:

- the kernel log;
- snapshots of hilog, processes, threads and services;
- a screenshot.

To read them: boot the recovery (Power + Volume up), then run `get_logs.bat` / `get_logs.sh`. See
[docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).
